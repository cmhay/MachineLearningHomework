    "## 4 Multi-class Classification [30 points]\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, you will use logistic regression and neural networks to recognize handwritten digits (from 0 to 9). Automated handwritten digit recognition is widely used today - from recognizing zip codes (postal codes)\n",
    "on mail envelopes to recognizing amounts written on bank checks. This exercise will show you how the methods you have learned can be used for this classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of the exercise, you will extend your previous implementation of logistic regression and apply it to one-vs-all classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a data set in `MC_data1.mat` that contains 5000 training examples of handwritten digits (This is a subset of the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist) handwritten digit dataset). The `.mat` format means that that the data has been saved in a native Octave/MATLAB matrix format, instead of a text (ASCII) format like a csv-file. We use the `.mat` format here because this is the dataset provided in the MATLAB version of this assignment. Fortunately, python provides mechanisms to load MATLAB native format using the `loadmat` function within the `scipy.io` module. This function returns a python dictionary with keys containing the variable names within the `.mat` file. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 5000 training examples in `MC_data1.mat`, where each training example is a 20 pixel by 20 pixel grayscale image of the digit. Each pixel is represented by a floating point number indicating the grayscale intensity at that location. The 20 by 20 grid of pixels is “unrolled” into a 400-dimensional vector. Each of these training examples becomes a single row in our data matrix `X`. This gives us a 5000 by 400 matrix `X` where every row is a training example for a handwritten digit image.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ X = \\begin{bmatrix} - \\: (x^{(1)})^T \\: - \\\\ -\\: (x^{(2)})^T \\:- \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ - \\: (x^{(m)})^T \\:-  \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of the training set is a 5000-dimensional vector `y` that contains labels for the training set. \n",
    "We start the exercise by first loading the dataset. Execute the cell below, you do not need to write any code here."

    "**python/numpy Tip:** When implementing the vectorization for regularized logistic regression, you might often want to only sum and update certain elements of $\\theta$. In `numpy`, you can index into the matrices to access and update only certain elements. For example, A[:, 3:5]\n",
    "= B[:, 1:3] will replaces the columns with index 3 to 5 of A with the columns with index 1 to 3 from B. To select columns (or rows) until the end of the matrix, you can leave the right hand side of the colon blank. For example, A[:, 2:] will only return elements from the $3^{rd}$ to last columns of $A$. If you leave the left hand size of the colon blank, you will select elements from the beginning of the matrix. For example, A[:, :2] selects the first two columns, and is equivalent to A[:, 0:2]. In addition, you can use negative indices to index arrays from the end. Thus, A[:, :-1] selects all columns of A except the last column, and A[:, -5:] selects the $5^{th}$ column from the end to the last column. Thus, you could use this together with the sum and power ($^{**}$) operations to compute the sum of only the elements you are interested in (e.g., `np.sum(z[1:]**2)`).
